And another thing / the grace you brought Othello / how you forged that moor / got him talking down his eloquence as if his tongue wasn’t part swan feather / 
part molasses / how you wrote a church of darkness steepled by Iago / and Ol’ Thello its soul / beacon of honor and light / Bruh / that shit literary fire / 
race-theory brimstone / middle-passage gold

but /

how you played Caliban / his tongue as Othello’s / and just as wronged / 
How you imbibed him with / emblemed him of colonized peoples / got me all riled up / 
imagining my ancestor’s vengeance / a rough blade thrust through Prospero’s proud heart / 
but you didn’t / Play ends / Cali still enslaved / Bruh / that shit fucked
